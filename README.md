# GitLab-Associate-Support-Engineer-Assessment

# Question #1

## _Write a Ruby or Bash script that will print usernames of all users on a Linux system_
   together with their home directories. Here's some example output:_

   ```
   gitlab:/home/gitlab
   nobody:/nonexistent
   .
   .
   ```

   # Step by Step   
   **How to List a username and directories in linux(WSL on windows)**

   ## 1. Open the Terminal

> Ctrl + alt + T for Linux users 


(_on windows and using WSL hit the windows key and type ubuntu_)

---
   ## Step 2: Create the Script with nano

   >nano list_users.sh

![Opening nano](images/open_nano_s.png)

>When Nano opens you will see it has it's own menu. 

![Opening nano](images/nano_opened_s.png)


---

## Step 3: Add the Script Content 

Copy and paste or write this script into the nano

```
#!/bin/bash
awk -F: '{ print $1 ":" $6 }' /etc/passwd
```

![Script in nano](images/script_written_s.png)

This will select the two fields we are interested in $1 _(name)_ and $6 _(directory)_.

---

## Step 4: Save and Exit nano
>- Ctrl + O  press Enter to save

>- Ctrl + X to exit

---

## Step 5: Make the Script Executable
In order to allow the script to run you need to make it executable. Otherwise you will get "permission denied". 


```
chmod +x list_users.sh
```
![Making executable](images/running_chmod_s.png)

---

## Step 6: Run the Script

now you can run the script and it should provide name and directories. 

```
./list_users.sh
```

# Question #2

## _We have sent you an image named `git_history.v3.png` showing a Git commit graph. What sequence of Git commands could have produced the commit graph depicted in the image?_

![Example of commit history](images/git_history.v3_S.png)

---

üí° **Note:**  
In most of my day-to-day projects, I work with Git and GitHub through the VS Code interface.  
I often use pull requests to merge branches and review code, which typically triggers checks or formatting tools if they're configured in the repo.

For this question, I referred to the [IONOS Git Cheat Sheet](https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/websites/web-development/git-cheat-sheet/) to confirm the merge commands.

---
So the commands I assume for this history would be 

### 1. Init and first commit
>git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"

### 2. Second commit
>git add .
git commit -m "second commit"

### 3. Create feature branch from here
>git checkout -b awesome-feature

 - still on awesome-feature branch

### 4. Go back to main before third commit
>git checkout main

### 5. Third commit on main
>git add .
git commit -m "third commit"

### 6. Back to feature branch
>git checkout awesome-feature

### 7. Commit on feature branch
>git add .
git commit -m "awesome feature"

### 8. Merge feature branch into main
>git checkout main
git merge awesome-feature

### 9. One more commit on main
>git add .
git commit -m "fourth commit"

# Question #3

## _Write a brief blog post for GitLab that explains what Git is and what it can do for you. (Note: This is just a scenario for you to demonstrate your written skills and ability to explain technical topics. We are not using these assessments for anything other than the recruitment process)._

![Title banner with Git logo, GitLab logo, and author Tom Burns-T](images/blog_banner_s.png)




## Hey, I‚Äôm Tom üëã I‚Äôve been asked to write a blog post for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) about Git:  
**What is it? What does it actually do for you?**

Git is a tool ‚Äî specifically, something called version control. I remember the first time I heard that phrase. One vague explanation led to another, and I still wasn‚Äôt sure what it actually meant.

So let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a way of tracking and managing changes in coding projects.

>_Maybe you read or perhaps you play video games. 
You can use a bookmark to save your place in a book and if your a true 90's kid like me you would use a save point in the game._ 

Git lets you:
- Save your progress
- Go back to earlier versions
- Collaborate with others without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes

![save point from ff7 and bookmarked books](images/save_point.png)

Imagine a team working together on a piece of software. To keep things stable, they don‚Äôt all edit the same copy of the code. Instead, they each create a **branch** ‚Äî a separate version of the project ‚Äî to work on specific features.

Once a feature is ready, they submit it for review. If everything looks good, it‚Äôs **merged** into the main branch ‚Äî the stable version of the code.

---

## Why It Matters

Mistakes happen. That‚Äôs normal. This is all part of the learning process when it comes to working in a team. You will find that something may work on your machine that after pushing causes a merging error. Usually it's not a big issue and can be resolved at the point of merging. Other times it can be an something after the merge has taken place. Luckily your working with version control so you can revert or rewind the clock back to a working version and hopefully figure out what the bug was. 

![Rewind](images/rewind.png)

With Git, you can trace exactly what changed, when, and who did it. You can fix issues or roll back to a working version ‚Äî without disrupting the whole team. 

---

## So What Does Git Do for You?

It gives you:
- Confidence to experiment
- A safety net when things go wrong
- A timeline of every step you and your team take

![safety net image](images/safety_net.png)



So when I say *Git is a version control tool*, I hope it now means something more useful than it did the first time you heard it.

# Question #4

## _Tell us about a recent issue you debugged or a problem you solved. How did you go about debugging it? What tools did you use? What was the outcome?_
